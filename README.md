## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS


### What I learned

I learned Tailwind CSS and I used it for the first time and it was really fun, writing CSS this way is maybe easier and also very helpful with the Js, instead of writing code to change an element from one state to the other, you can just toggle between classes and that saves you some time and thinking...

It's easier to do this than to think hard about a classname for this element and also worrying about best and meaningful naming conventions. This is a better way.
```html
<h2 class="mx-auto text-dark-grayish-blue dark:text-dark-grayish-blue">Drag and drop to reorder list</h2>
```

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com) - The official docs helped me so much, it was easy to understand and I recommend it to anyone who wants to write CSS - the fast and the Tailwind way.
